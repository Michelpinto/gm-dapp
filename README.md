# Basic Dapp Project

This project demonstrates how to send ether from your account to another one by simply adding the address, a simple message and the amount in ether.

I've used solidity for the smart contract, hardhat for the environment, and ethers.js to interact with the contract. UI was done using next.js(react) and Styled components.

To get started with this project, clone the repo and follow the instructions: 

1. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory.
2. Run `npm run` start to start the project.
3. Code! ðŸš€
